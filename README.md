# SmokingLifeEffect

Statement:
Smoking is leading cause of Lung diseases, heart diseases and Cancer.
As the Smoking Impact is seen after long term, people tend to ignore its side effect. 
If we are able to show the actual impact of smoking on health and wealth on longterm based on Smoker's daily consumption, 
it will act as deterrent and might force smoker to quit.

Solution:
We shall be creating the Power BI Dashboard. 
We shall be taking Input from User : 1.Smoking Period,2.Current Daily Intake 
Based on the data, we shall be able to show the user dashboard which shows health and wealth impact.
Dashboard shall show health and wealth comparison chart if user decides to stop smoking today vs 5 years including:
1. Life Expectancy, 2. Smoking Costs based on current rate
